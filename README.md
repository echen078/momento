# Momento

Momento is a photo-centric mapping app for Los Angeles. Users upload photos, pin them to map locations, and build a visual record of their exploration. A community heatmap aggregates public activity so users can discover where people are actually going.

## Features

- **Interactive map** — Leaflet map (CartoDB Voyager tiles) centered on LA with click-to-pin photo uploads
- **Photo uploads** — Multipart upload with JPEG/PNG/HEIC support, automatic image normalization
- **Authentication** — JWT-based signup/login with protected routes and persistent sessions
- **Personal gallery** — Browse your photos in a responsive grid with search, tag filtering, and date ranges
- **Community explore** — Paginated public photo feed with likes, owner badges, broken-image placeholders, and in-feed editing for your own uploads
- **Photo likes** — Like/unlike public photos from Explore or the photo detail modal; like counts persist on the server
- **View on Map** — Jump from a photo's detail modal to its pinned location on the map
- **Community heatmap** — Aggregated density overlay of public photos with week/month/year/all-time toggles
- **Tagging system** — Add/remove tags, suggested tags, clickable tag filters synced to URL params
- **Photo detail** — View/edit caption, tags, and public/private visibility; owner-only delete
- **Design system** — CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography, and shared component classes
- **Search & filter** — Full-text caption search, multi-tag filtering, date range filtering with debounced input

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite 8, React Router 7, React Leaflet, Axios |
| Backend | Express 5, Node.js |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas via Mongoose 9 |
| Auth | JWT (jsonwebtoken) + bcryptjs |
| File uploads | Multer (disk storage), Sharp (image processing) |
| Map tiles | CartoDB Voyager (via CARTO CDN) |
| Testing | pytest + requests (E2E) |

## Architecture

Momento is a monorepo with a React frontend (Vite) and an Express backend. The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/uploads` requests to Express on port 5001. Authenticated routes use JWT middleware; photo metadata is stored in MongoDB Atlas and image files are saved to `server/uploads/`.

### Login Flow

When a user logs in, the frontend sends credentials to the Express server, which verifies the password with bcrypt and returns a JWT. The token is stored in `localStorage` and attached to subsequent API requests.

![Login authentication sequence diagram](docs/architecture/login-flow.png)

The sequence above shows the full login path: `LoginPage.jsx` calls `AuthContext`, which posts to `/api/auth/login` via `axios.js`. The Express server routes the request to `authController.js`, which looks up the user in MongoDB. On success, bcrypt validates the password, a JWT is generated, and the token is saved to `localStorage` before the user is redirected to the map. On failure, a 401 response triggers an error message on the login page.

### Gallery Search Flow

Authenticated users can search their personal gallery by caption, tags, and date range. The search request is scoped to the logged-in user's photos and returns paginated results.

![Gallery search flowchart](docs/architecture/search-flow.png)

The flowchart above shows how a search query travels through the system: the user types into `SearchBar`, which passes filters to `GalleryPage`. The page calls `GET /api/photos/search` via axios (with the JWT attached), Express verifies the token through the `protect` middleware, and `searchPhotos` in `photoController.js` queries MongoDB for matching photos. Results are returned with pagination metadata and rendered in the gallery grid.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### MongoDB Atlas Credentials

This project uses MongoDB Atlas as its database. To get your credentials:

1. Log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to the **momento-prod** cluster
3. Go to **Database Access** in the left sidebar to find your username and password
4. If you don't have a database user yet, ask a team member with admin access to create one for you

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `server/`:

```env
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

- **Important:** Use `PORT=5001` (not 5000). On macOS, port 5000 is used by AirPlay Receiver and will cause 403 errors. The Vite proxy in `vite.config.js` is configured to forward `/api` requests to `localhost:5001`.
- Set `MONGO_URI` to your Atlas connection string with your database username and password filled in
- Set `JWT_SECRET` to a random string (you can generate one with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)

Then start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | No | Create account, returns JWT |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | No | Login, returns JWT |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Yes | Current user profile |
| POST | `/api/photos` | Yes | Upload photo (multipart, field: `photo`) |
| GET | `/api/photos` | Yes | User's photos |
| GET | `/api/photos/public` | Optional | Paginated public photos (includes `likeCount`/`likedByMe` when authenticated) |
| GET | `/api/photos/search` | Yes | Search by caption, tags, date range |
| GET | `/api/photos/heatmap` | No | Heatmap points with period filter |
| GET | `/api/photos/:id` | Optional | Single photo (owner or public) |
| POST | `/api/photos/:id/like` | Yes | Toggle like on a public photo |
| PUT | `/api/photos/:id` | Yes | Update caption, tags, visibility |
| DELETE | `/api/photos/:id` | Yes | Delete photo (owner only) |

## Testing

E2E tests use **pytest** and hit the running Express server over HTTP.

```bash
# Install test dependencies (one-time)
cd tests
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests (backend must be running on port 5001)
pytest -v
```

Test files follow the pattern `tests/test_sprint<N>_<feature>.py`. Shared fixtures (base URL, auth helpers) are in `tests/conftest.py`.
